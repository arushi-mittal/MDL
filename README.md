# Machine Data and Learning

This repository contains all the assignments done as part of the Machine, Data and Learning course at IIIT Hyderabad (Spring 2021).

## Structure

- Genetic Algorithms: A project involving using genetic algorithms to improve an overfit vector by generalizing it.

- Linear Programming: A linear programming approach to find the best policy for a problem involving path finding.

- Linear Regression: An assignment involving using linear regression to find bias, variance, mean squared error and best fit of a dataset using linear regression.

- POMDP: An assignment involving using POMDP solvers to find the policies and results of a given belief state problem.

- Value Iteration: An assignment involving value iteration to find the optimal path that converges at the given Bellman factor.
